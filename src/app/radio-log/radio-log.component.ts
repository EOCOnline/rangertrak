   *  - CallSign's text now colors by ranger identity via `rangerColorFor` - the exact same
   *    hash-based color already used for that ranger's map marker/trail (ranger-icon.ts),
   *    so the same person's reports are easy to pick out scanning down the column, and the
   *    color matches what a scribe already sees on the map for that ranger.
   *  - Address/Notes get `tooltipField`: AG Grid's own cell-level tooltip, which (unlike the
   *    native `title` on Notes' cellRenderer span, still left below) covers the WHOLE cell
   *    including the empty space past a truncated value, not just the visible characters
