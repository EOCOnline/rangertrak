/**
 * E-64: a thin shell owning route `/map`. It owns ONLY the page wrapper, the engine
 * switch, and mounting exactly one engine at a time - everything else (each engine's own
 * coordinate/zoom readout, overview map, Instructions, All/Selected checkbox) stays inside
 * LmapComponent/MapLibreComponent, per the maintainer's explicit "should not be merged without
 * reason." No shared base class, no changes to either engine's internals.
 *
 * Leaflet is imported eagerly here (it's the hardcoded default - no auto-detection, that
 * mechanism is deferred pending real usage). MapLibre is `await import()`ed only when the
 * switch is actually flipped, so a visitor who never touches it never downloads its ~966KB
 * chunk - this is the entire reason a route-level shell exists rather than statically
 * importing both engines into one component.
