/**
 * E-109 **Setup files**, v2 (2026-08-31, ADR D-48 - "a lazy-loaded route inside RangerTrak...
 * since others will always generate a mission"). A pre-mission provisioning tool: any
 * combination of settings, roster and locations (plus roster photos), packaged into one file a
 * coordinator hands to a scribe before a mission starts - or several such files, each carrying
 * a different slice (a Rangers-only file, a Locations-only file, a command-staff subset), all
 * loadable in one batch, each MERGING into what is already on the device rather than replacing
 * it wholesale.
 *
 * **The user-facing name is "Setup file(s)", never "Mission Zip"** - see mission-zip.ts's own
 * header comment for the full "no zip in user-facing copy" rule and why the module/route/file
 * names underneath keep their original spelling regardless.
 *
 * Deliberately its OWN route (`/prep`), not folded into Rangers' existing Import/Export roster
 * controls - those already do one clear job (roster + photos only) and this does a related but
 * distinct one (any of settings/roster/locations, no field reports, meant for a mission that
 * has not started yet). The two ARE the same style ("Setup files") and share an icon family so
 * an operator learns to associate them, but stay separate controls so neither one's own confirm
 * dialog has to describe what the other one does.
 *
 * No main-nav entry, same deliberate choice the Log page already made (E-57(1)) - this is a
 * pre-mission tool a coordinator reaches for occasionally, not a page a scribe needs mid-
 * mission. Findable from Rangers' own roster-management controls instead.
