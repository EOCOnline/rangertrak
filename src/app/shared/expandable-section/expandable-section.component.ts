/**
 * A labelled block of secondary content, collapsed by default - click the heading to open.
 *
 * Sibling to `SectionComponent` (same `summary`/`[rtSummary]` call-site API), for content
 * that specifically wants to start OUT of sight: an exceptional/rarely-needed action (a
 * danger zone), or a long list a reader scans selectively rather than reads start to end
 * (FAQ). Deliberately a SEPARATE component, not a mode on `SectionComponent` - that
 * component's own predecessor (`DisclosureComponent`) was removed as collapsible app-wide
 * 2026-08-25 ("Remove all collapsable sectinos: all should be visible"), and `SectionComponent`
 * now always renders open with no toggle state at all. This component is the 2026-08-29
 * exception to that: the maintainer asked for exactly this pattern in three places in the
 * same feedback batch (F29-18 danger zones, F29-31 FAQ, and Help's Log-inside-Feedback
 * decision) - reusing `SectionComponent`'s name for the opposite behaviour would misdescribe
 * it for its other, still-always-open callers.
 *
 * Wrap several in a `<mat-accordion multi>` for independent open/close (FAQ); a single one
 * needs no accordion wrapper (danger zones, Log-in-Feedback).
