/**
 * Where the MapLibre worker bundle is served from. maplibre-gl v6 splits its worker into
 * a separate ES module (plus a large shared chunk it imports by relative path), rather
 * than inlining it as v5 and earlier did.
 *
 * By default v6 derives the worker URL from its own module URL, which after Angular's
 * esbuild bundling resolves to `/maplibre-gl-worker.mjs` at the site root - a file no
 * build step ever emits. The request then hit the dev-preview server's SPA fallback and
 * came back as index.html with `Content-Type: text/html`, so the worker was constructed
 * from HTML and died on the spot.
 *
 * That failure is completely silent: MapLibre fires no error event, the map still paints
 * background layers on the main thread, and the map simply shows blank forever - because
 * both vector tiles AND GeoJSON sources are parsed in the worker. Pointing MapLibre at a
 * copy we actually ship (see angular.json's assets entry, which copies the worker and its
 * shared chunk side by side so the worker's relative import resolves) is the fix.

/**
 * One-time global MapLibre setup: points it at the worker bundle we ship, and registers
 * the `pmtiles://` protocol handler. Idempotent - safe to call from every map
 * component's constructor, which is exactly how it is used.
 *
 * ROOT-CAUSED 2026-09-01 (read pmtiles@4.5.0's own source, not the minified bundle
 * guessed at): `Protocol`'s default `PMTiles` instance uses `SharedPromiseCache`, whose
 * `getDirectory()` never evicts its cache entry when the underlying fetch rejects - only
 * a later `AbortController` listener does, and only for the specific ref that triggered
 * the abort. A directory fetch that rejects any other way (a Range request answered `200`
 * instead of `206`, a bad ETag, a non-2xx status) leaves a permanently-rejected promise
 * cached under that byte range, so every later tile needing the SAME leaf directory
 * rejects instantly with no network request at all - which is what a live CDP probe this
 * same day showed (55 fetches, 7 aborted, 0 ever re-fetched, always a contiguous
 * rectangular strip of tiles). Combined with maplibre-gl's own `TileManager._loadTile`
 * (dist/maplibre-gl-dev.mjs), which has no `AbortError` special case and parks ANY
 * rejected tile in `state: "errored"` forever, one poisoned directory entry reads as a
 * permanently gray region of the map.
 *
 * Pre-registering the bundled archive here with `ResolvedValueCache` instead - "a cache
 * ... where promises are never shared between requests" per pmtiles' own doc comment -
 * sidesteps the poisoning entirely: a failed fetch is never cached as pending, so the
 * next tile that needs it just tries again. Trade-off, real but small: unlike
 * `SharedPromiseCache`, concurrent tiles needing the same still-loading directory don't
 * share the in-flight request, so a cold map can issue a few duplicate header/directory
 * fetches. Cheap (tens of KB) next to a permanently blank strip of the map. See the
 * roadmap's Sept 1 (Opus) session write-up and its Sonnet handoff doc for the full
 * source trail; `map.refreshTiles()` (mapLibre.component.ts) is the other half of this
 * fix - a bounded retry for whatever this doesn't catch.
 *
 * The registration key must be the SAME string `buildPmtilesStyle()` embeds in
 * `pmtiles://<url>` below (`DEFAULT_PMTILES_URL`, unresolved) - `Protocol.add()` keys on
 * `source.getKey()`, which for `FetchSource` is the exact URL string passed to its
 * constructor, and `Protocol.tile()` recovers that same string by slicing the style's
 * `pmtiles://` URL apart. Resolving it to an absolute URL first would silently register
 * a second, default-cached PMTiles instance instead of replacing this one.
