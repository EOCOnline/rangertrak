 * that function, `LocationCategoryType.color` is always a literal hex (mission-migration.ts's
 * own comment on DEFAULT_LOCATION_TYPES explains why it deliberately skips the
 * `--rt-status-*` semantic-token indirection `statusColorValue()` resolves) - so no
 * `statusColorValue()` call is needed here, and the fallback is a neutral grey for a
 * category name the mission's list no longer has (renamed/deleted after the location was
 * placed), same "never silently invisible" reasoning as fieldReportStatusColor's callers.

/**
 * MapLibre's paint expressions are evaluated by its own WebGL renderer, not the DOM/CSSOM -
 * a `var(--rt-status-urgent)` string that resolves fine inside a Leaflet `L.divIcon`'s real
 * DOM/SVG (ranger-icon.ts) is meaningless there. A raw color (a user-picked custom status
 * color) passes through untouched, same tolerance `statusColorValue()` itself documents.
 *
 * **Not just `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue(...)` - tried
 * first and confirmed wrong.** `--rt-status-*` (`_tokens.scss`) is declared with
 * `light-dark(#hexLight, #hexDark)` as its value, and `getPropertyValue()` on a custom
 * property returns that raw, UNEVALUATED source text verbatim (custom properties are
 * untyped - the browser has no reason to resolve a color function inside one). Confirmed
 * live: `getPropertyValue('--rt-status-urgent')` literally returns
 * `"light-dark(#B3261E, #FF6B5E)"`, which MapLibre's own color parser cannot parse.
 * `getComputedStyle(el).color`, by contrast, is always resolved by the spec - the browser
 * has to serialise `color` as a concrete `rgb()` no matter what produced it. So: apply the
 * candidate value as `color` on a real (connected, so it inherits the page's actual
 * `color-scheme`) element, read the resolved `color` back, discard the element. Not reactive
 * to a live light/dark toggle - resolved once when the GeoJSON is (re)built, same refresh
 * cadence every other marker property already has.
