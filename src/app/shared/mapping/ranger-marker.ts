 * completing F29-7/8/ADR D-49's "engine-agnostic" intent) so `mapLibre.component.ts` and
 * `radio-log.component.ts` - neither of which touches Leaflet - can use these without
 * pulling the `leaflet` package into their own bundles. `ranger-icon.ts` still owns the
 * `L.DivIcon`-returning wrappers for the two genuinely-Leaflet consumers
 * (`mini-mapLeaflet.component.ts`, `mapLeaflet.component.ts`) and imports these back from here.
 *
 * E-86 (narrowed 2026-08-24: "ignore the team concept for now, just make ranger markers
 * unique"): every ranger gets a distinct marker - shape AND color, both derived purely
 * from their callsign - so the same ranger looks identical everywhere (main map, Entry
 * mini-map) and across sessions/devices, with no stored state and no roster lookup
 * needed at draw time.
