/**
 * The Leaflet half of ranger/evidence marker drawing - `L.DivIcon` wrappers around
 * `ranger-marker.ts`'s pure color/SVG functions. Only `mini-mapLeaflet.component.ts` and
 * `mapLeaflet.component.ts` (both genuinely Leaflet-based) import from this file; anything
 * that just needs a color or an SVG string (`mapLibre.component.ts`, `radio-log.component.ts`)
 * imports from `ranger-marker.ts` instead, so the `leaflet` package (2026-09-02: previously
 * ~146KB, present in Entry's own initial bundle per a live PageSpeed "unused JavaScript"
 * finding) no longer follows those two into their own chunks. See `ranger-marker.ts`'s
 * header comment for the full split rationale (F29-7/8, ADR D-49).
 *
 * ADR D-42 phase 5 (2026-08-25): callers used to pass `callsign` directly. Two DIFFERENT
 * rangers with no callsign - the population D-42 exists to serve - hashed to the identical
 * empty string, so their markers (and, via `drawTrails()`'s matching grouping key, their
 * trails) were indistinguishable. Callers now pass `rangerUid || callsign`: `rangerUid` is
 * the surrogate key (ADR D-42) and is unique whenever it's set, so it's preferred; `callsign`
 * remains the fallback for reports with no `rangerUid` (pre-migration data, or a callsign
 * that matched no current roster row). Only when BOTH are blank does a report fall through
 * to `UNASSIGNED_MARKER` - genuinely no data to distinguish it by.

/**
 * A deterministic, distinct Leaflet icon for a given ranger identity key - same key
 * always yields the same shape+color, no lookup or stored assignment required. Shape and
 * color are derived from independent bit ranges of one hash, so the two don't visibly
 * correlate (two rangers sharing a color won't reliably also share a shape).
 *
 * `key` is `rangerUid || callsign` at every call site (D-42 phase 5 - see this file's
 * header comment). Originally hashed `callsign` directly: a genuinely blank callsign used
 * to fall through to `hashString('Unknown')`, so EVERY report with no callsign got the
 * identical shape+color - not just "as ambiguous as before," but actively worse, since two
 * DIFFERENT callsignless rangers' reports then looked like one consistent identity moving
 * around (and, via `drawTrails()`'s matching key, could be joined into one bogus trail
 * between them). Keying on `rangerUid` when it's set fixes that: it's the surrogate key,
 * unique per ranger regardless of callsign. Only a key that's blank even after that fallback
 * (no `rangerUid` AND no `callsign`) routes to the fixed `UNASSIGNED_MARKER` - genuinely no
 * data left to distinguish it by.
 *
 * `statusColor` (raised live, 2026-08-26): an optional halo drawn BEHIND the ranger's own
 * shape, so a report's configured status (Normal/Need Rest/Urgent/...) reads at a glance on
 * the map without opening the popup - the same color the Mission page's status editor and
 * the Entry/Reports status controls already use (`radioLogStatusColor()`, this module's
 * sibling file), not a second palette. A real SVG circle behind the shape rather than a CSS
 * `filter: drop-shadow(...)` - Leaflet's `divIcon` container is sized exactly to `iconSize`
 * (no guaranteed overflow room for a blurred filter to bleed into without clipping), where
 * an SVG element drawn inside a larger viewBox has no such risk. Omitted entirely (falls
 * back to the plain 20x20 icon) when no status color resolves, so a report with an unknown/
 * blank status draws exactly as it always has.
