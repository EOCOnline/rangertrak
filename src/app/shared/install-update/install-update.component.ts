/**
 * E-55: RangerTrak used to offer "install this app" and "a new version is ready" through
 * four different, unrelated implementations - the navbar's own button, Settings' own panel
 * (raw hex colours, a fixed 250px width, opacity:0.8 - see git history), the footer's update
 * indicator, and an entirely separate, never-cleaned-up "Add to Home Screen" button in
 * app.component.ts/.html with its own duplicate `beforeinstallprompt` listener and state
 * (which, unlike the other three, never hid itself after the app was actually installed -
 * InstallableService's `appinstalled` handling didn't apply to it because it wasn't using
 * InstallableService at all). This is the one component now used everywhere: navbar, footer,
 * and Settings all render this instead of their own bespoke markup.
 *
 * An update takes priority over an install offer when both are true at once - a stuck-on-
 * old-build incident (E-43) matters more than a missed install opportunity.
 *
 * E-57(1) simplification (2026-08-20): the compact form (navbar/footer) went back to a
 * v0.12-era shape - one small pill: an icon, a short label, done, no separate sentence next
 * to a separate CTA button. The maintainer, comparing mockups: "the install button can be
 * much simplified, as it used to be, say in version 11 or so" (see git history around
 * v0.12.0 for the actual shape this revives). Install and update-ready now share one pill
 * silhouette with only the icon/label/tint differing, so they visibly read as the same
 * affordance rather than two unrelated widgets.
 *
 * E-43's original top-sticky `[fixed]` banner is gone, replaced by `[stickyBottom]`, used
 * once, in footer.component.html: "I like the button on the bottom more than a bar. can it
 * go into the footer though?" `position: sticky; bottom: 0` on the footer's own instance
 * settles into normal flow once the real footer is reached and pins to the viewport bottom
 * otherwise - the same guarantee the old top banner made (visible regardless of scroll, so
 * a scribe deep in a tall Field Reports/Log page still sees it), without a second,
 * update-only instance living outside the footer. Because it's the footer's own instance
 * rather than a dedicated urgent-only one, it shows the install offer too, not just
 * update-ready - a small extra visibility win, not something asked for on its own.
