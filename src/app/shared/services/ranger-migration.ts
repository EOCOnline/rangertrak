 * Versioned, forward-only migration for the persisted ranger roster, plus the ID assignment
 * ADR D-42 introduced.
 *
 * Mirrors `mission-migration.ts` deliberately - same shape, same conventions, same purity
 * rules - rather than inventing a second way to do this. Settings has had real migration
 * machinery since Sprint E; rangers and field reports had **none at all** (both were bare
 * `JSON.parse()` calls), which is the gap this closes.
 *
 * Maintainer, 2026-08-26: *"there are no existing reports. no need for back fill at this
 * point. all should have some schema version of some sort for the future when we do need
 * this."* So this deliberately does NOT carry defensive backfill logic for legacy data that
 * does not exist - it establishes the **seam** a future migration hooks into, while the
 * install base is still small enough that introducing a versioned storage shape is free.
 * Doing it now is the whole point; it gets materially harder once real rosters are in the
 * field. (An earlier draft of this file carried a `backfillReportRangerIds()` that resolved
 * each stored report's ranger from its callsign - removed on that direction, since the data
 * it rescued does not exist. If a future build DOES need it, it belongs as a numbered
 * migration step in `radio-log-migration.ts`, not as permanent defensive code.)
 *
 * Everything here is PURE - no injection, no logging, no storage access - so it is
 * unit-testable without a browser and safe to call from both entry points (RangerService's
 * load path and BackupService's importMission).

 * 1 - the versioned `{ schemaVersion, rangers }` wrapper; every ranger gains an internal
 *     surrogate key `uid`, and any credential it carries is canonicalized into `id`
 *     (ADR D-42). Note "canonicalized", not "assigned", for `id` specifically: a ranger who
 *     has not checked in yet legitimately has no number, and this app does not mint them.
 *     `uid` IS minted - see `newRangerUid()` for why those two differ.
 *
 * The surrogate key was folded into version 1 rather than added as a version 2, deliberately:
 * this migration had not been wired into any service when it was added, so no localStorage
 * anywhere has ever held a version-1 roster. A version 2 would have been a migration step
 * from a state that never existed.

 * fold it into `id` themselves before a ranger ever reaches this function. The `(ranger as

 * step: that path hands this function raw, untyped `JSON.parse()` output straight from
 * localStorage, which - for anyone updating from a build old enough to predate `id` entirely -
 * may still be a literal `{rew: "VI-0038", ...}` object with no `id` at all. Dropping this
 * would silently blank out that person's only recorded credential on their very first load of
 * a phase-8-or-later build.
 *
