// 2026-08-31: renamed from field-report.interface.ts / FieldReportType / FieldReportsType /
// FieldReportStatusType / FieldReportSource / fieldReportArray, a naming holdover from before
// the page itself was renamed Reports -> Radio Log (0.75.0's ICS-309/213 restructuring) -
// "Field Report" had become an inconsistent second name for the same thing the rest of the
// app calls a Radio Log entry. Includes the persisted-shape property name (`logEntries`,
// below) and the localStorage key (`radio-log.service.ts`'s `storageLocalName`) this time,
// not just type names - the app has no real users yet ([[no-real-users-yet-rename-freely]]),
// so there is no stored data or exported mission file anywhere to orphan.

// E-41 phase 1 (2026-08-26): was a dead, commented-out field (`// source: FieldReportSource`
// below) until the maintainer confirmed it directly - "Yes, we should include a field
// acknowledging source type." Every entry gathers this now, not just ones flagged for a 213.
//
// A string-literal union, not a numeric TS `enum` (this file's original commented-out sketch
// used one) - same idiom as this project's own StatusKey (status-color.ts), and a deliberate
// choice, not just a style preference: Signal Forms' native `[formField]` binding for a
// radio input compares the model value against `element.value` with `===`
// (`node_modules/@angular/forms/fesm2022/signals.mjs`'s `setNativeControlValue`), and every
// DOM attribute value is a string - a numeric model value could never strictly-equal a radio
// element's own string `value`, so the control would silently never show as checked. Confirmed
// by reading that file before choosing this, not guessed.
// F29-43 (2026-08-29): 'Phone' added - 'Voice' stays first (array order is UI order, and
// radio-over-voice is the hot-path common case).

/**
 * Data to store for each field report
 *
 * E-41 phase 1 (2026-08-26): five fields added for ICS-309/213 support - data collection
 * only, per the maintainer's own explicit scoping ("does not want export/reporting logic
 * built yet, only the fields and the model to hold them"). `source` is gathered on every
 * report, always. The four `*213` fields are opt-in per entry (`generates213` gates the
 * other three) - "the 213 stays opt-in per entry... the scribe should be able to click a
 * 'Yes, generate an ICS-213' [button/flag] from this message." All optional rather than a
 * schema-version bump: existing stored reports simply lack them (`undefined`), which is a
 * safe, already-correct answer for a plain `JSON.parse()` (radio-log.service.ts has no
 * migration path today, unlike MissionType) - nothing reads these fields yet, so there is
 * nothing for their absence to break. `message213`/`replyRequested213`/`recipients213` are
 * a best-effort answer to "whatever the 213's initial version requires" - now confirmed
 * against the real official ICS-213 AcroForm (E-31/E-41 phase 3, 2026-08-26 - see
 * `shared/export/ics213-pdf.ts`).
 *
 * `recipients213` changed from `string` to `string[]` the same day (maintainer, E-103
 * scoping): a per-mission definable checklist of routine recipients (Incident Commander, Ops
 * Section, EOC, ...) is coming, checkbox-shaped, and a list is the natural fit - a comma-
 * joined string would only need re-splitting once that lands. **No migration written or
 * needed** - the maintainer's own call: "This app is not currently in use." Entry still
 * collects free text today (the checkbox UI is E-103, not yet built); `mergedFormValue()`
 * splits the typed string into this array at the form/storage boundary.
