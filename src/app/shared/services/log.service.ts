 *
 * Why this exists at all, given `console` already does logging: `console.*` writes to
 * devtools and **nowhere the page can read back** - there is no API to retrieve console
 * history. A scribe running RangerTrak on a field tablet has no devtools, so an in-app log
 * requires capturing entries ourselves. What this adds over `console` is (a) visibility
 * inside the app, (b) structured records that can be filtered and exported, and (c)
 * something a user can actually attach to a trouble report. Entries are still mirrored to
 * the console, which stays the better tool when devtools *are* available.
