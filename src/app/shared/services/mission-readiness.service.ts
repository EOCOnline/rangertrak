/**
 * ADR D-32: a persistent readiness indicator reporting whether *this device* is actually
 * prepared for an unattended, offline mission - not whether the app is technically usable.
 * All six signals were already measurable with nothing new to persist; this is the service
 * that surfaces them. Never reads as "you cannot work" - a scribe can always log a report
 * regardless of state.
 *
 * Two signals are synchronous (mission named, roster loaded - both driven off subscriptions
 * this service already holds). Three are async (offline map tiles saved, the bundled
 * MapLibre asset warmed, storage-eviction protection granted) and only refreshed on
 * `refresh()` - called by MissionReadinessComponent's ngOnInit, which runs fresh on every
 * page since HeaderComponent (and therefore this component) is instantiated per page by
 * PageComponent.
 *
 * **Level formula (a judgment call, not specified elsewhere - documented here so it can be
 * revisited deliberately rather than rediscovered by reading the code):**
 * - **red** - mission not named, or roster still the untouched hardcoded sample. Nothing
 *   resembling real setup has happened yet.
 * - **amber** - basic setup is done (mission + real roster) but a resilience gap remains:
 *   the operating period has expired, or any of the three offline-prep signals is missing.
 *   The app works fine online; a real network loss would expose the gap.
 * - **green** - all six signals pass. Prepared for the worst case (total network loss).

   * Counts saved offline map tiles without importing leaflet.offline at all.
   *
   * Found live on rangertrak.org (2026-08-20, from a real user's Log page export) after
   * this originally called leaflet.offline's own `getStorageLength()` via a dynamic
   * `import()` - chosen specifically to keep the ~160KB package out of the eager bundle
   * (see git history). That import broke silently in production: esbuild splits a
   * dynamically-imported CJS dependency into its own chunk whose only real ESM exports are
   * internal interop helpers, not the package's named exports - `const { getStorageLength
   * } = await import(...)` destructured `undefined`, and every call threw "is not a
   * function". Reproduced locally the same way once actually tested across several page
   * navigations rather than a single page load (which happened to dodge it) - see
   * [[verify-the-measurement-itself]].
   *
   * `getStorageLength()`'s own implementation (leaflet.offline's TileManager.ts) is just an
   * IndexedDB count - `openDB('leaflet.offline', 2, {...}).count('tileStore')` - simple
   * enough to do directly with the raw IndexedDB API, sidestepping the bundler issue
   * entirely rather than working around it.
   *
   * Safety constraint that shapes this whole method: `LmapComponent`/`MiniMapLeafletComponent`
   * elsewhere in the app open this exact database via leaflet.offline's own `openDB`,
   * which creates the `tileStore` object store the FIRST time the database is opened at
   * all (an `onupgradeneeded` with `oldVersion < 1`). If this method opened the database
   * first - before a user ever visited a map page - it would create an empty schema at
   * version 1 with no upgrade logic of its own, and leaflet.offline's later `openDB(...,
   * 2, ...)` would then see `oldVersion` as 1, not 0, and skip creating `tileStore`
   * entirely - silently breaking the real offline-tile-saving feature for anyone whose
   * first interaction with this database happened to be the readiness check. So this only
   * ever opens the database after confirming (via `indexedDB.databases()`) that it already
   * exists, and never supplies a version or an upgrade handler.
