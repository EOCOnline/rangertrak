/**
 * E-87 Stage 1 (2026-08-31) - the PWA-side half of "Command Post Server: serving the mission
 * to nearby devices" (`E-87 Command Post Server.md` in the private docs). Opt-in: when a
 * mission turns on `commandPostEnabled` and names a `commandPostServerUrl`, this POSTs a
 * redacted snapshot of the radio log there every time it changes, so `tools/command-post-
 * server.js`'s `/view` page has something current to show teams reading over the CP's WiFi.
 *
 * Design constraints straight from the scoping doc's §2.2/§2.3:
 * - **The PWA is authoritative and pushes; the server is a dumb read-only mirror.** No sync,
 *   no conflict resolution, no identity - one writer, many readers, matching the read-only
 *   need the 2026-08-15 exercise actually validated.
 * - **Degrades safely.** The command post server is a separate OS process on a separate
 *   origin that may not be running at all - a failed POST is caught and logged at `warn`,
 *   never `error` (a CP server not running is the NORMAL state for most missions, not a
 *   bug - same "don't log a false alarm for an expected state" lesson this app's own
 *   2026-08-31 log-noise audit already applied elsewhere, e.g. entry.component.ts's
 *   callsignCtrlChanged fix). The standalone PWA is byte-for-byte unaffected either way.
 * - **The roster never goes over the wire.** §4 point 1's own recommendation, followed
 *   directly here rather than left as an open question: `buildPayload()` sends reports and
 *   mission info only - never `RangerService.rangers`. A report's own `callsign` (already
 *   denormalized onto every `RadioLogEntryType` - "the primary evidence of who reported",
 *   see that field's own comment) is what identifies who's on the map; full names, phone
 *   numbers and photos stay on the scribe's device, never published onto what may be an open
 *   hotspot with unknown devices in range (ADR D-35).
 * - **No join code/trust model for this v1** (the scoping doc's §4 point 2, left open there)
 *   - the WiFi/hotspot's own password is the access boundary for now: anyone who can join the
 *   command post's network can already reach `serve-dist.js`'s existing static assets on the
 *   same LAN today, so this doesn't lower the bar further. A shared join code is a reasonable
 *   fast-follow if a mission's threat model calls for it, not built here.
