 * E-222 / ADR D-67: the mission journal - what was done to the mission's data on this device
 * (loaded a demo, restored, imported, backed up, printed...), kept apart from the debug log
 * (LogService), which is in memory and clearable. Stored like the After Action notes: a versioned
 * wrapper in RecordStore, encrypted with the roster when device encryption is on.
 *
 * Append-only: there is deliberately no edit, delete or clear method, and the journal is not
 * cleared by Start a real mission, a demo load or Clear radio log. Nothing in the app deletes all
 * data on the device, so nothing removes it. Restore never replaces it either (BackupService only
 * adds an entry). record() saves synchronously, so an entry made just before a page reload is kept.
 *
 * Events, never contents: pass call signs, counts, file names and scenario or mission names only.
