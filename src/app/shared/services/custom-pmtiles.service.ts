/**
 * A scribe-supplied `.pmtiles` file, stored on THIS device only, for MapLibre to use in
 * place of the bundled `vashon.pmtiles` extract.
 *
 * Raised in the roadmap's own "New backlog items, 2026-08-27": MapLibre's only offline
 * coverage is that one bundled file - unlike Leaflet's `leaflet.offline`, which fetches and
 * caches individual raster tiles live as a scribe pans around, PMTiles is a single archive
 * covering one fixed region, so there is no per-tile "save what I'm looking at" equivalent
 * to build here. The roadmap named the two realistic options: "bundle another region"
 * (a GIS data-generation task - tippecanoe/planetiler against real source data, not
 * something a coding session can produce) or "let a scribe supply their own .pmtiles file."
 * This is the second one: a coordinator who has generated or downloaded coverage for their
 * own area of operations loads it here, once, and it persists on this device from then on.
 *
 * D-35: operator data, same as ranger photos - never bundled into the repo, stored only in
 * this browser's IndexedDB. Same storage shape as `RangerPhotoService` (a single object
 * store, Blobs as values) - IndexedDB is the only browser storage that can hold a file this
 * large (a real regional PMTiles extract easily runs tens of MB; `localStorage`'s ~5-10MB
 * quota and string-only values rule it out entirely).
