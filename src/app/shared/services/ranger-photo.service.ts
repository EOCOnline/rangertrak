/**
 * Ranger photographs, stored on THIS device only.
 *
 * D-35: a photograph of a volunteer is operator data, not an application asset. It never
 * goes in `src/assets/`, because that is a public repo and a public site, and git history
 * makes it a one-way door. A team leader loads the photos into their own command-post
 * browser before a mission, and they stay there.
 *
 * Why this exists at all (E-38): a photo beside the callsign is how a scribe confirms *who*
 * a report is about while entering it. The feature was removed when the repo went public
 * and never rebuilt, which cost a real field capability to solve a publishing problem.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 * 1. **Photos are downscaled on import.** They are rendered at 40px in the grid and 60px on
 *    the Entry form; the originals average ~400KB. Storing them at MAX_EDGE keeps a 200-photo
 *    roster in single-digit MB, which matters on a tablet that also holds map tiles.
 * 2. **Object URLs are built once, up front, into a synchronous map.** The three render
 *    sites are string-building cell renderers that cannot await anything, so the alternative
 *    would be rewriting all of them.
 *
 * D-42 phase 6: `build-roster-zip.js` (`rangertrak-InternalDocs/roster-build/`, outside this
 * repo) names photo files after a ranger's `callsign`, and bundles built by it may already be
 * in a team's hands. Matching tries a ranger's `id` stem first, then falls back to `callsign`,
 * for both import matching and lookup - never id-only, or every existing bundle orphans.
