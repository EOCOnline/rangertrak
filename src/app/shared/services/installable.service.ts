/**
 * Whether this app can be installed on this device, and doing it.
 *
 * E-37. Three surfaces offered installation - the footer's "Add to Home Screen", the
 * navbar's "Install", and Settings' install panel - through three unrelated mechanisms, and
 * two of them did nothing at all:
 *
 *  - `installableEvent` started as `1`, a truthy sentinel, so `isInstallable` was true
 *    before any event fired. Both surfaces showed unconditionally, including in browsers
 *    that never offer installation and on devices where the app was already installed.
 *  - The navbar and Settings buttons used the HTML attribute `onclick="onInstallBtn()"`
 *    rather than Angular's `(click)`, so the click resolved against `window`, where no such
 *    function exists. `NavbarComponent.onInstallBtn()` was never reached - and its body was
 *    `//! TODO: Implement me!!!` anyway.
 *  - `showPrompt()` opened a confirmation dialog whose actual `prompt()` call was commented
 *    out, so even the reachable path could not install anything.
 *
 * Nothing anywhere listened for `appinstalled` or checked `display-mode`, so the app never
 * knew whether it was already installed.
 *
 * This is now the one place that knows. Install and update stay separate concepts - updates
 * are UpdateService/SwUpdate's job (R7) - but they are both about "is this device running
 * the right thing", so they belong side by side in the UI, not in three unrelated corners.
