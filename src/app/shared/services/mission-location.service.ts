 * Mirrors RangerService's modern parts deliberately - signal + ReplaySubject dual exposure,
 * a versioned localStorage wrapper, uid-keyed CRUD - without the legacy Excel-import cruft
 * that predates that pattern. See ranger.service.ts if a future change wants to bring the
 * two even closer together.
