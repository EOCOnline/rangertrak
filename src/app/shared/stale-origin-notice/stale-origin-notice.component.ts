/**
 * E-45: `www.rangertrak.org` redirects to the canonical `rangertrak.org` at the Cloudflare
 * edge - but only for a request that actually reaches Cloudflare. A PWA bookmarked or
 * installed from `www.` *before* that redirect existed registered its own service worker at
 * that origin, which now intercepts navigation and serves its own stranded cache before any
 * HTTP-level redirect can fire. That visitor never reaches Cloudflare, never reaches the
 * canonical host, and - because UpdateService (E-43) deliberately never auto-reloads -
 * never gets prompted to update either. They're stuck.
 *
 * The only code that will ever run for that visitor is whatever shipped in that stranded
 * cache, which is why this has to be app code, not a server-side fix. It's a client-side
 * "you're on the wrong address" nudge, not a redirect - a service worker can't make the
 * BROWSER navigate to a different origin from inside itself without the visitor's own
 * action.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY TEMPORARY - not a permanent runtime cost. Affects only visitors who
 * bookmarked/installed from `www.` before the redirect existed, a shrinking population.
 * Added 2026-08-20; remove this component, its import/selector in app.component.ts/.html,
 * and its barrel export once affected users have plausibly migrated - a few months out,
 * call it early 2027, sooner if nobody's hit it. Don't wait for a formal removal ticket;
 * deleting a component you're confident is done is fine.
