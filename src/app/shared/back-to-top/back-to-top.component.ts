 * E-57(3): a floating "back to top" control, shown only once the page is actually tall
 * enough and scrolled far enough to need one.
 *
 * Split out of E-57's other two asks (phone header/footer review, sidebars-vs-accordions)
 * deliberately - the roadmap flags this one as small, self-contained, and shippable on its
 * own, which the other two are not.
 *
 * Why a scroll listener rather than IntersectionObserver on a sentinel: this app is
 * zoneless, and either way the visibility state has to be a signal to reach the template.
 * A passive scroll listener reading scrollY is the smaller of the two, and there is no
 * sentinel element to place that would survive every page's own layout.

   * requiring both `scrolled > 600` and `scrollable > 600` left almost no scroll range where
   * the button could actually show - confirmed live by walking scrollY in 30px steps: with
   * scrollable=712, it was visible only for scrollY in (600, 712], a ~110px sliver right at
   * the very bottom. Scrolling up "just a tad" from there reliably dropped below 600 and
   * hid it - exactly the reported symptom ("only shows when the footer is visible, vanishes
   * if scrolled up 30px"). The floor below scales the threshold down for shorter pages
   * instead of using the same fixed 600px regardless of how much content there is.
