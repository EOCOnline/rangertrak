/**
 * ADR D-32: the persistent readiness indicator, rendered once inside HeaderComponent so it
 * appears on every page. A colored dot rather than text/icon - the header strip is already
 * dense on a phone. Deliberately never reads as a permission gate: nothing here disables
 * Entry or any other action.
 *
 * The dot itself is a `routerLink` to /mission - a reasonable general-purpose fallback, and
 * where three of the six signals live anyway. The full six-item breakdown, each row its own
 * link straight to the section that fixes it (F29-21, 2026-08-30 - "each readiness line
 * links directly to the page+field that fixes it"), lives in HeaderComponent's own hover
 * panel now, not here - see that component's `readinessItems()` for the ported version of
 * what used to be this component's own `items` getter.

   * Bug found live 2026-08-31 (maintainer, testing 0.90): on a touch device the dot's own
   * `routerLink="/mission"` hard-navigated away instead of joining the pill's unified
   * tap-to-toggle behavior, so the dot alone still acted like the OLD separate popup this
   * whole pass (see this file's own header comment) was supposed to have retired everywhere.
   * Root cause: HeaderComponent.onStatusClusterClick() deliberately ignores a click that
   * lands on `.readiness-dot` ("its own routerLink already handles those") - correct on
   * desktop (hover already reveals the panel; the click-through is a bonus shortcut), wrong
   * on touch (there is no hover there, so ignoring the dot's tap left it as the one element
   * in the pill that navigates instead of toggling).
   *
   * Fix: `isTouchOnly()` below drives the template's `[routerLink]` binding to `null` on
   * touch - `null` is RouterLink's own documented way to render an inert (non-navigating)
   * anchor, which is more reliable than trying to race `event.preventDefault()` against
   * RouterLink's own click handling (it does not consult `defaultPrevented`, so calling it
   * from a second listener on the same click cannot be trusted to stop the navigation).
   * `dotActivated` lets HeaderComponent fold the dot into its existing
   * `panelOpenOnTouch` toggle instead, so touch behaves identically everywhere in the pill.
