/**
 * E-114 Report Packet, Phase 1 (2026-08-31, Private Roadmap.md's E-114 §2/§2a/§2b). A queued,
 * store-and-forward artifact: a device (typically a remote ranger's own phone, running in
 * "lite mode" - E-114 §1a) bundles whatever field reports it has filed into one small file,
 * which the main station later merges in via `RadioLogService.mergeIncomingEntries()`
 * (E-114 Phase 0) - the SAME merge function whether the packet arrives by email attachment,
 * a messaging app, a thumb drive, or read back over voice and re-typed (in which case there is
 * no packet at all - see §2a, voice is the fallback that needs nothing built).
 *
 * Plain JSON, not a zip - deliberately, unlike a Setup file. A radio log entry carries no
 * binary payload (no photos), so there is nothing zipSync() would earn its keep packing, and
 * plain JSON is also pasteable as message-body text, which a zip is not - directly relevant to
 * a carrier with no attachment path (packet radio, an SMS body). `.txt`, not `.json`, is the
 * recommended file extension for the actual export - E-114 §2b found Chromium's Web Share
 * file-sharing allowlist does not confirm `.json`, and this content already reads as plain
 * text either way.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes `rangers` (a lite device has no roster to begin with - E-114 §1a's
 * zero-provisioning design), `settings`, and `locations` - a Report Packet is reports only,
 * never a second way to move mission configuration. `mission`/`event`/`opPeriod` travel as
 * ADVISORY CONTEXT for the import warning ONLY (E-114 §3) - free text today
 * (`mission.interface.ts`), never a key, never a gate; a mismatch must warn, not block.
