/**
 * E-109 **Setup files**, v2 (2026-08-31, ADR D-48). A PRE-mission provisioning artifact -
 * any combination of settings, roster, locations and photos, collapsing what otherwise takes
 * three separate imports (roster JSON, then photos, then a mission JSON) into one file a
 * coordinator hands to a scribe before a mission starts.
 *
 * **The user-facing name is "Setup file", never "Mission Zip".** The file/type/identifier
 * names in this module deliberately keep their original `missionZip` spelling - they are
 * internal, and renaming them would churn every import for no user-visible gain - but the word
 * "zip" must not appear in a button, heading or help sentence except when literally naming the
 * technical file type ("downloads a .zip file" is fine prose). Three separate features were
 * all branded around the word "zip" until 2026-08-31, which is precisely why nobody could tell
 * them apart.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the same shape as `BackupService.MissionExport` (see the roadmap's own
 * "Mission Zip is NOT the same artifact as the existing mission export"): that one is a
 * mid/post-mission *backup* (user-facing: "Mission backup"/"Mission restore") and always
 * carries field reports; this one is a *template* taken before a mission has any, so it never
 * does. Two schemas, sharing only the ranger/mission types themselves - not sharing one schema
 * with a nullable `fieldReports` field, which would make "is this a backup or a template?" a
 * runtime guess instead of the file's own shape.
 *
 * **v2 (2026-08-31): every payload category is independently optional, and PRESENCE OF THE KEY
 * - not emptiness - means "this file includes this category, apply it."** An omitted key means
 * "don't touch this category at all," which is what makes a Rangers-only file, a
 * Locations-only file or a command-staff-subset file possible, and what lets several of them
 * be loaded in sequence, each merging into what the previous one left. v1 files always carried
 * `settings` + `rangers` both, so under this rule they still apply everything they always did;
 * the only behavior change for them is that rangers now MERGE rather than wholesale-replace.
 *
 * Teams is still excluded - not yet a real entity (D-a, still gated on real-world input). When
 * it ships it joins additively as `teams?`, needing no version bump of its own, exactly the way
 * `locations` did on 2026-08-31 (finishing checklist gap #1, once ADR D-49 shipped Locations as
 * the Facilities half of D-45 and the maintainer said live that a Setup file should carry them
 * - "no need to wait for Teams to include Locations"). This v1 -> v2 bump is ONLY for the
 * optional/omittable-`settings`/`rangers` semantic change, which a reader cannot infer from the
 * payload shape alone.
 *
 * The bundled `settings` deliberately travels with whatever agency-supplied keys it already
 * holds (`googleGeocodingApiKey`, `commandPostServerUrl`) rather than stripping them - decided
 * 2026-08-31: a Setup file is an explicit, operator-initiated device-provisioning action, the
 * same category D-35 already sanctions for `MissionExport`, and the whole point is a receiving
 * device that works without someone re-typing a key.
 *
 * Photo matching reuses `RangerPhotoService`'s own filename-stem convention (a ranger's `id`
 * if set, else `callsign`, uppercased) - not reinvented here. "A wrong photo is worse than no
 * photo" (roster-build's own stated rule) - this module never guesses a match; it just
 * carries whatever `RangerPhotoService.allPhotoBlobs()` already resolved on write, and hands
 * raw filename/bytes pairs back on read for `RangerPhotoService.importFiles()`'s own matching
 * to run again against the (possibly different) roster being loaded into.
