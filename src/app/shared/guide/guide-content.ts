/**
 * Every screen's on-page guidance, in one file.
 *
 * Before the Material-M3 pass (2026-08-25) this content was 15 `<rangertrak-section>`
 * blocks spread across 8 components - "Instructions", "Tips", "Advanced",
 * "Privacy & data handling", "Location Guidance", "Grid Menu Keyboard interaction" - each
 * sitting permanently in its page's main column, below the grid or form it described.
 * Nothing collapsed them (the 2026-08-25 de-collapse pass made them all always-visible),
 * so a scribe who had read them once still scrolled past them on every visit.
 *
 * They live here instead, behind one Guide button that sits in the same place in every
 * page header. Two things fall out of that which are worth the move on their own:
 *
 *   1. The relevance audit the roadmap has asked for twice (2026-08-22 and again
 *      2026-08-24 - "ensure all such verbiage still makes sense") is now a review of ONE
 *      file, not a hunt across eight components.
 *   2. Reference material stops competing with the thing the page is actually for. The
 *      redesign's page-order rule puts the primary object first; guidance was the main
 *      thing violating it.
 *
 * What deliberately did NOT move here: anything a scribe acts on rather than reads.
 * Export controls, row-count pickers, the map engine switch and every destructive button
 * stay grounded on their page - hiding a control behind a drawer is a different and worse
 * bargain than hiding an explanation.
