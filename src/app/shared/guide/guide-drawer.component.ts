/**
 * The one Guide drawer, rendered once in app.component.html and opened by the Guide button
 * in every page header. Holds the reference material that used to sit permanently in each
 * page's main column as `<rangertrak-section>` blocks - see guide-content.ts for the full
 * reasoning and for the content itself.
 *
 * Built from a plain fixed-position `<aside>` plus `cdkTrapFocus` rather than
 * `mat-sidenav`: a sidenav requires wrapping the entire application in
 * `<mat-sidenav-container>`, which takes over the app's scrolling and layout - a large,
 * app-wide structural change to gain a panel that slides. The CDK focus trap is the part
 * that actually matters for accessibility, and it is available on its own.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a `mat-dialog`: a dialog is modal and demands a decision. This is
 * reference material read alongside the screen it describes, so the page stays visible and
 * scrollable behind it on a wide window.
