/**
 * Help tab: where to report a problem or suggest something - was "Log" (0.74.0), renamed and
 * repurposed 2026-08-29 (D-d, F29-26). Two things merged into it:
 *
 * - The feedback form (ADR D-15), moved here from About (0.78.0's F29-25 pass put it there
 *   as an interim consolidation while every tab's repeated About/feedback/How-it's-built
 *   blocks were being stripped - this is where the maintainer actually wanted it to land:
 *   "having Log as an optional part of the Help page's feedback tab").
 * - The diagnostic Log, folded in as a closed-by-default ExpandableSectionComponent rather
 *   than kept as its own tab - the maintainer's own reasoning: "the main reason to
 *   read/copy/send the log is for feedback purposes." This is not a round trip back to
 *   0.74.0's "buried in prose" problem - a labelled section inside a Feedback tab is still
 *   far more findable than a link in another tab's paragraph, it just no longer needs a tab
 *   of its own.
 *
 * Content rule for every tab in this folder: describe only controls that actually exist and
 * work. See "E-84 Documentation Rewrite Plan.md" section 2 for the audited keep/remove list.
