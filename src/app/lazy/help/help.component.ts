/**
 * The in-app user documentation, and (E-84 decision, 2026-08-24) the canonical one: it ships
 * with the app, always matches the running version, and works with no connection - which is
 * the situation this product exists for. FIELD-GUIDE.md is now the pre-mission companion,
 * not a second copy of this.
 *
 * This page was one long scroll until E-84. That is how six shipped features (route trails,
 * per-ranger markers, base-layer switching, offline tile saving, the theme toggle, the
 * readiness dot) ended up documented nowhere at all - there was no obvious place to add
 * anything and no way to see what was already covered. Content now lives in sibling
 * components under ./tabs, one per tab. "Mission setup" merged into "Start here" as one
 * onboarding checklist (D-d, F29-32, 2026-08-29), and "After mission" split out of "Your
 * data" - a merge and a split that cancel out. "Log" (2026-08-27, so the Log page,
 * deliberately absent from the main nav, stayed easy to find) is now "Feedback" - it also
 * carries the feedback form, per the maintainer's own reasoning that reading/copying the log
 * is mostly a feedback-adjacent task. "Entering reports" and "Maps" (2026-08-30, live
 * request): moved into the Entry and Map pages' own Guide drawers instead - both were
 * screen-specific operating instructions, which is what the Guide (not general Help) is for;
 * see guide-content.ts.
 *
 * Content rule for anything added here, from the maintainer: keep it minimal, the UI should
 * be self-explanatory. These tabs deliberately cover only what a screen cannot say for
 * itself. Where the UI is NOT self-explanatory, the fix belongs in the UI.
