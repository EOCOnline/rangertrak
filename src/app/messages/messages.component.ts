/**
 * ICS-213 general messages - field reports with "Also generate an ICS-213" checked
 * (`generates213`), scoped 2026-08-27 as part of the ICS-309/213 IA restructuring (see the
 * roadmap's own scoping note for the full reasoning).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a second AG Grid clone of Radio Log/field-reports.component.ts: a message
 * is opt-in per report, so this list is expected to stay short, and the useful unit here is
 * one whole message read at a time, not a row scanned across columns. List + expanded-detail
 * instead, with a "Print as ICS-213" button wired directly to `fillIcs213Pdf()` (`0.57.0`,
 * E-31/E-41 phase 3) - built the same day as the log-shaping half of that work, but never
 * wired to any UI until now.
 *
 * `FieldReportType` has no Approved-by-Name field today, so that one of the form's eight
 * fillable fields is left blank on the printed PDF rather than invented - `fillIcs213Pdf()`'s
 * own doc comment already states this principle for the Reply block, and it applies just as
 * much to data nobody has actually collected. Subject is filled (report.subject213).
 *
 * Raised live 2026-08-30: this page showed neither Subject nor Operator, and had no way to
 * edit a message at all (the Radio Log grid was the only edit path, for every field except
 * these 213-specific ones - Radio Log has no columns for them). Now shows both, and adds its
 * own edit form (message/subject/recipients/reply-requested) - see onEdit()/onSaveEdit()
 * below for the D-47 tie-in (editable indefinitely, warn once printed, don't touch the
 * original report time).
