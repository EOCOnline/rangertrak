/**
 * Only the Entry page (the landing route, and the screen an operator spends a mission in)
 * is eager. Everything else is a `loadComponent` split point.
 *
 * Every route used to be eager, which meant the initial bundle carried AG Grid, xlsx,
 * MapLibre and the full map/grid page code before the first screen could render - most of
 * it for pages a given user might never open. The heavy libraries now land in the chunk of
 * the route that actually uses them: AG Grid + xlsx with Reports/Rangers/Settings/Log,
 * Leaflet with `/map`.
 *
 * Note this trades *initial* download, not total: app.config.ts registers
 * withPreloading(PreloadAllModules), so these chunks are still fetched right after the app
 * becomes stable. That is deliberate for an offline-first PWA - everything still ends up
 * precached and available without a network - but it means the win here is time-to-first-
 * screen, not bytes over the wire across a whole session.
 *
 * E-64 exception: MapLibre is NOT preloaded with `/map`, even though Leaflet is. It sits
 * behind a plain `import()` call inside MapPageComponent's engine-switch handler rather
 * than a second `loadComponent` route, and PreloadAllModules only walks the Routes table
 * above - it has no way to see (or preload) a dynamic import buried inside a component
 * method. A visitor who never flips the switch never fetches it, full session or not.
