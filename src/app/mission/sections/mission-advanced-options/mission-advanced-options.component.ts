 * Data safety (Storage Protection, Mission Backup) and the page's Danger Zone (reset

 * device).
 *
 * Material-M3 pass 2026-08-25 split those two apart: they were one undifferentiated
 * "Advanced Options" block, so an unrecoverable "replaces everything on this device" import
 * looked exactly like the reversible export beside it. Sprint C split out of the 429-line mission.component template - see
 * mission.component.ts for the rest.
 *
 * The Font Explorium (a dev-time typography-comparison tool, not something a scribe in the
 * field has any reason to see) used to live here too - extracted 2026-08-20 to a standalone
 * font-explorium.html in the parent directory, outside the app entirely.
 *
 * Injects its own services directly (all `providedIn: 'root'`) rather than threading them
 * down as Inputs, since none of this section's actions need to hand anything back to the
 * parent except "reset defaults", which does affect sibling sections' displayed `settings`
 * and stays owned there.
