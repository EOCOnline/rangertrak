(The regions do have center points however.)\n\n       Only 20 characters are valid: \"23456789CFGHJMPQRVWX\"\n\n       Global RegEx: /(^|\\s)([23456789C][23456789CFGHJMPQRV][23456789CFGHJMPQRVWX]{6}\\+[23456789CFGHJMPQRVWX]{2,3})(\\s|$)/?i\n       This extracts (in capturing group 2) a global code at the start or end of a string, or enclosed with spaces, but not in the middle of a string.\n\n       Local RegEx: /(^|\\s)([23456789CFGHJMPQRVWX]{4,6}\\+[23456789CFGHJMPQRVWX]{2,3})(\\s|$)/?i\n\n       If the query matches, and the user has not entered any other text, then another location must be used to recover the original code. If you are displaying a map to the user, then use the current map center, pass it to the recoverNearest() method to get a global code, and then decode it as above.\n\n       If there is no map, you can use the device location. If you have no map and cannot determine the device location, a local code is not sufficient and you should display a message back to the user asking them to provide a town or city name or the full global code.\n\n       * * *\n\n       Open Location Codes are encodings of WGS84 latitude and longitude coordinates in degrees. Decoding a code returns an area, not a point. The area of a code depends on the length (longer codes are more precise with smaller areas). A two-digit code has height and width[height_width] of 20 degrees, and with each pair of digits added to the code, both height and width are divided by 20.\n\n       The first digit of the code identifies the row (latitude), and the second digit the column (longitude). Subsequent steps divide that area into a 20 x 20 grid, and use one digit to identify the row and another to identify the column.\n\n       If the query matches, and the user has not entered any other text, then another location must be used to recover the original code. If you are displaying a map to the user, then use the current map center, pass it to the recoverNearest() method to get a global code, and then decode it as above.\n\n       globalPCode = encode(latDD,longDD);  // Need locality/focus (within half a degree latitude and half a degree longitude, or ideally 1/4 degree, 25km at equator) pt to get local +code.\n\n       The shorten() method in the OLC library may remove 2, 4, 6 or even 8 characters, depending on how close the reference location is.

They can radio in their locations - using a variety of location codes, and be centrally tracked.\nThere are a number of ways to geocode a latitude & longitude. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Location_Code#Other_geocode_systems for a list.\nFeatures\n\nProgressive Web App (PWA) this should be able to function (in the future, possibly with some degredation) even if the person using this is offline.\nVersions after 0.0.10 are generated with Angular, so will run on most modern web browsers, regardless of device/form factor\nOpen Source: free & available to enhance\nSupports recording locatinos as: lat/long, or What3Words, Google +Codes, or physical Street Addresses\nAuto-lookup of Ham Radio operators by callsign\nGoogle or Leaflet/ESRI maps\nRangers can be in Teams; both are easily edited/sorted/filters\nDocumented using [https://compodoc.app/guides/jsdoc-tags.html]Compodoc\n\nFuture Roadmap\n\nTo work with out flaws!\nSave and reload data to local files\nAllow loading of additinoal layers (e.g., an image of trails, local features),\nperhaps with https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage\nimproved docs: screenshots and architectural diagrams\n\nconsider https://github.com/EventEmitter2/EventEmitter2 for multi-threaded msgs with service workers\n\n\n\n\n\nItems (still) requiring online access\n\nGeoCoding an address\nAll maps (for now)\n3Word functionality (for now)\n\nTo Run\n\n(The Vision:) Simply visit https://www.RangerTrak.org once and the 2nd time you visit you will be given an option to 'install/download' the web page/application. That should put an icon on your homescreen or desktop that you can thereafter access without Internet access!\n\nTo Build and Test\n\nGrab a local copy of Github.com/eocOnline/Rangertrak\n\nInstall NodeJS and NPM\n\ncd RangerTrak\n\nnpm install\n\nng serve -o\n\nor Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\n\n\nRunning unit tests\n\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nNone currently!\n\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice.
