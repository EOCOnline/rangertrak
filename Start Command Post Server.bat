REM RangerTrak Board - double-click launcher (Windows).
REM
REM Raised live 2026-08-31: "anything to simplify creation or admin?" - before this, starting
REM the server meant knowing what a terminal is, what npm is, and typing a command correctly.
REM This exists so a non-technical coordinator can just double-click a file instead. It does
REM NOT replace `npm run command-post` for anyone comfortable with a terminal - both run the
REM exact same tools\command-post-server.js.
REM
REM E-216: checks Node.js (present, version 24 or newer), npm ci, and the build before running.
REM
REM %~dp0 is this .bat file's own folder, with a trailing backslash - used instead of assuming
REM the double-click starts in any particular folder, which Windows does not guarantee.
cd /d "%~dp0"
